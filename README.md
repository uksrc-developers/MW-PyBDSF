# MW-PyBDSF
---

This repository contains all the code relevant to running PyBDSF as part of the Multiwave Demonstrator Case.

## Introduction


Need to include the purpose of the code in the repo
A description of the repo and and the code in it

## Inputs and outputs




## Running MW-PyBDSF




## Future Work


These scripts focus on batching PyBDSF on Azimuth using a slurm cluster. There is the potential to adapt and/or generate scripts which allow for batching across different platforms.
There is opportunities for profiling and optimisation work to be carried.
